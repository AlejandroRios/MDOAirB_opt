Description:
    - This function calculates the thrust to weight ratio following the requiremnts
      of missed climb approach with one-engine-inoperative accoring to FAR 25.121.
      For this case the climb gradient expressed as a percentage takes a value of 0.021 (for two engine aircraft).
      The lading gear is up and takeoff flaps are deployed

Reference:
    - References: FAR 25.121 and ROSKAM 1997 - Part 1, pag. 142
